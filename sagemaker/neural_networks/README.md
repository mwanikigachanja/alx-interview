For this exercise, you will create a simple neural network example in an AWS SageMaker notebook. We'll use a synthetic dataset to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on two features:

Website visit duration
Number of pages visited.
This is a binary classification problem, and we'll use a small neural network for quick execution.

Step 1: Set Up AWS SageMaker Notebook
Launch a new SageMaker notebook instance.
Open a new Jupyter notebook in the instance.
Choose kernel conda_tensorflow2_p310.
