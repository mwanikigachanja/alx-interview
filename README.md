## Projects

### 0x00-pascal_triangle

This project involves generating Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The project includes functions to create and print the triangle for a given number of rows.

Key files and functionalities:
- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: Contains the function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n` rows.
- `0-main.py`: Test file to demonstrate the usage of `pascal_triangle(n)` function.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this repository up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mwanikigachanja/alx-interview.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd alx-interview
    ```

## Usage

Each project contains specific instructions and examples. For instance, to use the Pascal's Triangle project, navigate to the `0x00-pascal_triangle` directory and run the test script:

```bash
cd 0x00-pascal_triangle
python3 0-main.py
```

This will execute the test file and display the Pascal's Triangle for the specified number of rows.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, suggestions, or bug fixes, please follow these steps:
